# 🌺 Day 1
<sub>**07/06/2025**</sub>

I initially changed my mind and decided to learn using a textbook, but after studying the first chapter of the *HSK 1 Standard Course* book, I realized I’d progress too slowly this way. So, I went back to the original study plan:

1. Watch a *Little Fox Chinese* video (following the site’s recommended order). 
2. Add the new words to both *Pleco* (for spaced repetition) and *Immersi* (to reinforce through video context). 
3. If I get tired of *Little Fox* or want to practice reading/spelling, I’ll read a story on *Du Chinese* or watch a video on YouTube. Again, I’ll add unfamiliar words to *Pleco* and *Immersi*.
4. Practice forming my own sentences. As usual, I’ll use *Pleco* and *Immersi* whenever I need to learn a new word. 
5. Look things up online for extra practice. 

I’ll stick to this routine until I reach SHK 1. I won’t move forward until I’ve mastered most of the words in my current study list (which includes spelling). 

Below are some words I learned on Day 1, back when I was still using the textbook: 

*(I hadn’t been introduced to questions or possessive forms yet, but they’re useful for building sentences and vocabulary.)*

# 🌺 Day 2:

From day two and beyond I didn't use a textbook anymore.

Here's what I did:

**30 minutes of videos of a Chinese person speaking.**

Chosen video: [L01| Comprehensible input Chinese | TPRS | Self-introduction in Chinese | my mum and my boyfriend](https://youtu.be/_CMzfhsCYrA?si=Q_8mo30a8s8ebMCJ) from [Lazy Chinese - Comprehensible Input](https://www.youtube.com/@comprehensiblechinese) (love that channel):  

Transcript:

I also shadowed her way of speaking (that's why it took 30 minutes).

Reviewed 64 words on Pleco SRS + watched the Day 2 review transcript video. I also used Immersi.

# 🌺 Day 7
<sub>**07/12/2025**</sub>

Same of Day 6. I also tried handwriting a little, but realized it’d slow me down a lot if I tried to learn how to write *every* character. I don’t even handwrite in my own language these days, and I’m not sure when I’d need to do it in Mandarin (speaking of which, I hope I can use a computer for the HSK test, so I only use pinyin).

# 🪷 My thoughts about this week

I know the basics of most of the content since I’d studied for about a month before. When I stopped back then, I could read simple texts, like children’s stories. The thing is, I didn’t care about tones, which was a huge mistake. I focused only on reading, thinking it’d be easier to learn tones later. Maybe that’s true, but it ended up being frustrating not knowing how to speak. That’s why I’m taking my time now to learn how to communicate properly. Right now most of my SRS time is spent on pronunciation.

Hope I can do more next week! 🍵
