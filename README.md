# About this repo
- 🥠 This repo is a work in progress catalog for my Mandarin learning notes.
- 🥮 Currently learning on my own, but I'll probably get a tutor once I hit intermediate level.  
- 🧧 I’ll document the resources I’m using (like apps, books, and other media)
- 🥡 It will contain reviews of what works and what doesn’t along the way.  
- 🥢 English isn’t my native language either, but I’m using English materials to practice both.
- 🐼 I’m skipping Hanzi handwriting for now, at least until I’m fluent enough to bother with it.

## 🥮 Current materials

<sub>I tried learning Mandarin for a month before - these are the resources I liked, so I'm sticking with them.</sub>

| Resource | Type | Free/Paid | Am I paying? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Immersi - Learn Chinese | [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.immersi.immersi&hl=pt_BR&pli=1) / [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/immersi-learn-chinese/id6501961705) | Free (Limited) | Not at the beginning (I'm still not paying) | Great tool for learning Mandarin through legended videos, including YouTube ones. You can watch videos by choosing a word or swapping the screen the same way you do on social media like Instagram Stories. |
| Du Chinese | [Android app / iPhone app](https://duchinese.net/) | Free (Limited) | Not at the beginning (I'm still not paying) | Learn Mandarin by reading stories. It's graded by levels. One of the best apps for learning Mandarin out there. |
| Pleco | [Android app / iPhone app](https://www.pleco.com/) | Free (in-app purchases) | - | No introduction needed. One of the most used apps for this purpose. A Mandarin dictionary and spaced repetition app. |
| Little Fox Chinese | [Website](https://chinese.littlefox.com/en) | Free | - | Great and simple but rich material for learning Mandarin through simple story animations. |

## 🥮 Strategy 

The objective is to learn both speaking and writing (by typing), so <strike>(different from the last time)</strike>, I'll focus on learning the tones and I won't move on to the next couple of words until I learn the ones I am currently practicing in speaking and writing.  

It's important to note that I'm learning two other languages besides Mandarin (with English being one of them), and they are *needed*, so I can't prioritize Mandarin above them. Thus, I have no rush with this _"project"_. I'll learn at my own pace, if not I might go crazy.  
  
I'll use AI to get some questions answered, but I'll try not to rely on it too much since I don't want to sound like I'm scripted by DeepSeek or something lol.  

I also don't know yet if I'll use a textbook. I'll update here about it later. I like understanding grammar, so maybe I'll do that.  
  
More details will go in the first note, which I should write as soon as this project actually starts :)

### 🌼 My plan is  
- Studying every day 
- Study a Little Fox episode
- Study a Du Chinese text
- Study the words from both apps on Immersi
- Try to create my own sentences in different contexts (writing and speaking)
- Use Pleco for spaced repetition
- Only move on after "memorizing" at least 90% of the words I'm studying
